# Resume-Laura-Quinn

Hi! 

My name is Laura, and I've created this repository for the purpose of working on / hosting a simple website to act as my virtual resume.
In doing so, I'm hoping to make this important documentation of my career capabilities into an interactive, accessible example of my basic coding capabilities. 

I hope you find the experience of reading through this resume refreshingly different and reflective of my interest/potential in the field of web-based programming, and more specifically, UX/UI Design. 

Best regards,

Laura Quinn
